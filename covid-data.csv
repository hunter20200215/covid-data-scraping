Those eligible can sign up for an appointment at www.DoINeedaCOVID19test.com. There are no out-of-pocket costs associated with the appointment. Additional updated details include the following: The site is open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., weather permitting.

Initially, the testing will be done in the parking lot of the Floyd County Health Department. This testing will only be done on pre-screened patients.Tests will be run by a non-governmental lab. The intent is to identify and test patients that do not require immediate hospitalization. The patients will be prescreened by the primary care provider or the Floyd County Health Department. The patient will then be given an arrival time. We are not doing on demand testing; the prescreening process is essential to avoid delays and wasted, unnecessary tests. On arrival, the patient will have a copy of their government ID and insurance card (if available) made using an electronic device. We will ask them for contact numbers. A swab will be done of the nasopharynx. We will notify the patient of test results. We anticipate the testing process itself will take less than five minutes. The results may take several days to return. We would like to emphasize that this process will not test people who show up without prescreening. We will not initially be testing walk-ins. Open Daily starting 3/20/2020 from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m., appointments only. This testing plan is a project in evolution. We will update you on changes in hours, format, and testing procedures.

Rehoboth McKinley Christian Healthcare Services - Drive thru site,"1901 Redrock Dr, Gallup, NM 87301",NM,87301,(505) 236-1074,"Type of Testing Drive Thru Site Dates & Times Daily 8am – 7pm Sites are designed to keep you and health care workers safe. Sometimes you stay in your car. Other sites will screen you before you come indoors. Please review the listings for each site. Some require you to call in advance or have a referral from your doctor or other health care provider. Some people will meet the clinical criteria to be tested. Some people will be advised to STAY HOME for a 14-day period to be extra safe. Some people will be directed to other medical services. It is critical that all New Mexicans know that those without symptoms of COVID-19 infection – those symptoms being fever, cough, or shortness of breath and/or – do not need testing for COVID-19. We are currently in allergy season, and having allergy symptoms such as sneezing, and itchy eyes, nose or throat is not an indication for testing. As we work to increase the state’s capacity for COVID-19 testing, the test needs to be prioritized for those with symptoms of COVID-19 infection: fever, cough or shortness of breath. Please trust New Mexico’s valued medical professionals who are working so hard to protect and treat the New Mexico public and only get tested if you are currently exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms."
